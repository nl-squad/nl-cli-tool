# ðŸš¢ nl-cli-tool

Tool for NL servers management and control. Created because of a lack of public tools for managing CoD2 servers. The settings should be defined in a `project-definition.json` file. You can create one basing on the example [sample.project-definition.json](https://github.com/nl-squad/nl-cli-tool/blob/main/sample.project-definition.json).
